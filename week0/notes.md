## Week 0 - Scratch
This week was primarily an introduction into computer science I learned how the basic Binary, ASCII, Unicode and RGB systems work, I also understood the guidelines on AI usage and that I'm able to use CS50's own AI model CS50.ai to solve the problems and nothing else.
The rest of Week 0's notes were on scratch and how the various blocks and conditionals work

# DragonVsDino.sb3 (Week 0 Project)
This weeks project was to make a Scratch game that
- must use at least two sprites, at least one of which must not be a cat.
- must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
- must use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at least one variable.
- must use at least one custom block that you have made yourself (via Make a Block), which must take at least one input.

I made a Dragon Vs Dinosaur fight, when the start button is clicked all Elements are automatically hidden and a soundtrack starts, I replicated a text flashing effect by changing the background to one with text and a replica without text this gave the text on screen a flashing/strobing effect.
Next the dinosaur is shown and goes through its different sprite variations creating a small animation then the dragon appears, when the user clicks on the dragon a small thunderbolt becomes visible momentarily this reduces a variable that is the dragons health the amount of health it reduces can be altered with the custom block I put in once the dinosaurs health is reduced to 0 when the player tries to click the dinosaur turns around and glides to a position off screen and then a You win text background is displayed

# What I learned
- How to use the custom blocks with inputs to have change-able values
- Finding unique ways to create effects (text strobe/text flash)
- How the order of instructions can and will affect the final output

# Possible Improvements
- More content/functionality
- Further bug testing
- Code optimisations

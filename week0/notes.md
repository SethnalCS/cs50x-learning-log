## Week 0 - Scratch
This week was primarily an introduction into computer science I learned how the basic Binary, ASCII, Unicode and RGB systems work, I also understood the guidelines on AI usage and that I'm able to use CS50's own AI model CS50.ai to solve the problems and nothing else.
The rest of Week 0's notes were on scratch and how the various blocks and conditionals work
